# Airbnb-NYC-2019-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

## Descrition
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Airbnb listings in New York City from 2019. The data provides insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings, including room types, pricing, locations, and availability. A Tableau dashboard has been created to explore and present these insights interactively.

## Project Overview
This project consists of two main components:

1. Dataset: A CSV file containing detailed information about Airbnb listings in New York City for the year 2019. This includes data about room types, prices, neighborhoods, availability, and more.

2. Tableau Dashboard: An interactive Tableau dashboard created to provide visual insights into the Airbnb dataset. The dashboard enables users to explore trends in prices, room types, locations, and other key metrics.

### Key Insights
1. Price distribution across different neighborhoods.
2. Correlation between room types and pricing.
3. Price variations based on the availability of listings.
4. Geographical trends in listing prices.

### Technologies Used
1. Python (for additional data processing, optional): Libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn can be used to analyze the data further.
2. Tableau: For creating interactive data visualizations and dashboards.
3. CSV: The primary data format for storing Airbnb listings information.
